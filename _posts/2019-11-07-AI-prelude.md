# Navi's Road to AI - Prelude ðŸŽµ
> Sharing my own experience in learning Artificial Intelligence

## Why Writing This
This fall I start my first graduate semester in UI. As a student with another background, ```CS 440 - Artificial Intelligence``` is the first PURE CS professional course I take, and it is also a starting point of my road to IT industry.

Thanks so much to this great course and the help of Professor Fleck, who is a very nice person, I really enjoyed the learning process and was deeply fascinated by the AI world. Hence, I think it is necessary to record my learning experience, not only as a review, but also as a *heuristic*.

>**heuristic**: the informed search strategy which uses a heuristic function to guide search.
